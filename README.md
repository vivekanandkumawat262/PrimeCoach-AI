Summary
We have a fully built, production-ready React frontend for a B2B Real Estate Due Diligence platform ("Rio Grande Due Diligence"). The UI and frontend logic are complete. We need a Senior Backend Developer to build the geospatial engine (Python/PostGIS) that powers it.

View the Live Frontend Here: https://nm-landguard.lovable.app (Review this link before applying to understand the scope.)

THE MISSION: You will build the "Brain" that connects to this "Body." You will write the Python scripts that query government APIs, analyze the data, and generate professional PDF and KMZ reports.

CORE DELIVERABLES:

1. The "10-Pillar" Data Engine (Python): Write robust scripts to query 10 specific APIs/Data Layers based on user coordinates or polygon inputs:

Historic: NMCRIS / HPD Spatial Buffers.

Water: NM Office of State Engineer (OSE) Basins & Wells.

Bio: USFWS IPaC (Critical Habitat).

Flood: FEMA NFHL API.

Energy: NM OCD (Oil/Gas Pipelines).

Geotech: USDA SSURGO (Soil) & USGS 3DEP (Slope/Elevation).

Infrastructure: Google Places (Fire/Hospital) & Google Solar API.

Wildfire: USFS Risk Data.

2. The "Risk Radar" Algorithm: Implement a scoring logic that normalizes these 10 disparate data points into a 0-100 "Risk Score" for the frontend Radar Chart visualization.

3. The "Pro Export" Suite:

Dynamic PDF: Generate a 6-page professional PDF report with dynamic maps, data tables, and citations.

KMZ Generation: Generate a Google Earth (.kmz) file overlaying the parcel boundary and identified risk buffers.

4. Integration:

Connect the existing "Generate Site Assessment" button to a Stripe Checkout webhook.

Ensure the "System Status" ticker on the frontend reflects simple API health checks.

REQUIREMENTS:

Expertise in PostGIS, GDAL, and Python Geospatial libraries (GeoPandas, Shapely).

Experience generating KMZ/KML files programmatically.

Ability to work with existing React/Supabase code to connect the backend.

Summary
Senior Full-Stack Engineer (React + Node + Stripe Connect) — SaaS MVP Build

We are building a booking and deposit web platform for dealerships. We have already completed full wireframes, UX flow mapping, and an AI-generated demonstration that shows how the product should look and function. The design direction, UI concepts, and user journey are fully planned. We now need a senior engineer to bring this into functional reality.

You will build the customer booking flow where a user selects an item, chooses a time, pays a refundable deposit, and receives confirmation. You will build a dealer dashboard where dealers can view bookings, manage schedules, assign staff, and update statuses. You will build an admin area for managing dealers, bookings, and logs. You will implement a complete authentication system with role-based access. You will integrate Stripe Connect using authorization-only deposit holds and webhook logic for release or refund. You will build secure API endpoints, scheduling and availability logic, notification systems for email and SMS, and deploy everything to Vercel and Supabase or similar.

Required skills include React or Next.js, Node.js using Express or Next API routes, real-world Stripe Connect experience, PostgreSQL or Supabase, authentication systems such as JWT, NextAuth, or Supabase Auth, REST APIs and webhook development, and clean Git workflows. Helpful additional experience would include booking systems, scheduling systems, SaaS dashboards, and Tailwind or similar UI frameworks.

Preferred stack includes Next.js 14, Tailwind, Zustand for state management, Supabase or PostgreSQL, Stripe Connect Standard accounts, Twilio for SMS, SendGrid or Resend for email, and Vercel for hosting.

The project is fixed price at 11000 USD with a timeline of 6 to 8 weeks. It is structured into milestones. All code must be clean, secure, documented, and production ready.

To apply, you must provide GitHub links to React and Node work, show an example Stripe Connect integration you have built, explain briefly how you would architect this project, and be willing to complete a small paid test task.

The paid test task is a simple demo: create a booking form with name and date, save it to a database, place a Stripe authorization-only five dollar hold, build a webhook to release or cancel the hold, and show a basic dashboard listing bookings.

Deliverables include production-ready code, API documentation, architecture notes, deployment instructions, a clean and well-structured repository, and no hardcoded credentials.

We have the vision, wireframes, flows, and demo already completed. We need a senior engineer who can execute, build fast, and deliver a reliable MVP ready for launch to clients, with clean fully-working code.
